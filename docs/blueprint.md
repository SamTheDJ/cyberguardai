# **App Name**: CyberGuard AI

## Core Features:

- Anomaly Detection: Analyze network traffic and logs for subtle, behavioral anomalies using machine learning algorithms.
- Deception Deployment: Autonomously deploy honeypots and deception tactics in a simulated environment when suspicious activity is detected to mislead attackers. A reasoning tool evaluates if the deception would likely be successful.
- Phishing/Deepfake Analysis: Analyze communications (emails, voice, video) to detect AI-generated scams using contextual markers.
- Automated Quarantine: Autonomously quarantine suspicious communications upon high-confidence detection. 
- Vulnerability Monitoring: Monitor live applications and CI/CD pipelines for critical vulnerabilities and insecure code.
- AI-Generated Patching: Propose, test (in a sandbox), and initiate deployment of AI-generated fixes or security rule updates to stop immediate risks.  A reasoning tool evaluates the fix before deploying it.
- Reporting Dashboard: Display threat intelligence data in an easy-to-understand format, highlighting key vulnerabilities and ongoing threats, showing a summary of each threat including the applied AI tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#624CAB) to convey sophistication and security.
- Background color: Very dark purple (#1A132F) provides a serious, tech-focused backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) highlights crucial data points and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a modern look. It is used for both headings and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets in patching and vulnerability analysis.
- Use minimalist, abstract icons to represent threat categories, security tools, and automated actions.
- Incorporate subtle animations when the AI agent identifies a new threat or deploys a defensive measure.
